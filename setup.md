**Install Python**

<p>In this lesson, we will be using Python 3 with some of its most popular scientific libraries.
Although one can install a plain-vanilla Python and all required libraries by hand,
we recommend installing <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>,
a Python distribution that comes with everything we need for the lesson.
Detailed installation instructions for various operating systems can be found
on The Carpentries <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#python">template website for workshops</a>
and in <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install">Anaconda documentation</a>.</p>
