**Install Python**

In this lesson, we will be using Python 3 in Jupyter Notebook with the following libraries: `flatten_json`, `pandas`, `requests`
Although one can install a plain-vanilla Python and all required libraries by hand,
we recommend installing <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>,
a Python distribution that comes with everything we need for the lesson.
Detailed installation instructions for various operating systems can be found
on The Carpentries <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#python">template website for workshops</a>
and in <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install">Anaconda documentation</a>.

If you don't have Jupyter or another Python environment set up, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to write your code. Another option is to use [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/uc-love-data-week/intermediate-apis/HEAD) -- this will spin up a notebook with the contents of this repo. 


**Install Libraries**

On macOS and Linux, you can install the packages on the command line using the following commands

`pip install flatten_json`

`pip install pandas`

`pip install requests`

On Windows, it's often easier to install using the Anaconda interface. 

1. Open Anaconda
2. Click on Environments
3. Search if your package you want to is already installed
4. If not, search for the package under _not installed_, then select the package and click "apply" to install
